## Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel:** Excel is utilized for data preparation tasks such as importing raw data, cleaning and transforming data, and performing preliminary analysis. It provides a familiar and versatile environment for handling structured data efficiently.
  
- **Power BI:**  Leveraged for building interactive dashboards with dynamic filtering, custom visualizations, and real-time insights, allowing for in-depth exploration of coffee market trends and consumer behaviors.

## Approach 
- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Microsoft Excel was used to import raw data, clean inconsistencies, and perform preliminary analysis. This step involved organizing data, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- **Data Transformation and Structuring:** Excel was further used to structure the data into a format suitable for Power BI analysis, creating calculated fields and aggregating data to simplify complex metrics, such as sales growth rates and regional comparisons.

- **Building the Dashboard:** Power BI was used to create interactive visualizations that provide insights into sales trends, regional preferences, and customer demographics. Power BI’s capabilities allowed for a streamlined, visually engaging dashboard experience, highlighting key insights.

- **Designing for Interactivity:**
The dashboard includes filters, slicers, and drill-down options, enabling users to explore the data from various perspectives, such as region, product type, or time period. This added interactivity enhances user engagement and insight discovery.

- **Testing and Optimization:** The dashboard was tested for accuracy and optimized for performance, ensuring quick load times and responsive interactions. Each visualization was reviewed to ensure it aligned with the project goals and provided meaningful insights into the coffee market.

## Key features
- **Data Integration:** Extracting and importing data from a source, including Excel files, for a comprehensive analysis of American Coffee data.
- **Data Validation and Querying:** Utilizing Excel to validate and transform data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for reliable insights and metrics.
- **Visualization:** Creating visually engaging and informative charts, graphs, and maps in Tableau to represent sales performance, revenue distribution, and manager performance.
